"""Lint guard: variant 0 is the role's baseline closure, every other
variant's closure MUST be a subset of it.

Background
==========
The matrix-deploy mechanism (docs/contributing/design/variants.md)
treats variant 0 as the all-flags-true baseline and lets later
variants pin individual dynamic flags to ``false`` to exercise the
out-of-group_names branch (see ``test_coverage.py``). The closure
of a "minimal" variant therefore SHRINKS relative to variant 0 —
it drops deps that the disabled flags would otherwise auto-include.
That shrinkage is by design.

What is NOT acceptable is a non-baseline variant that adds a dep
variant 0 does not have, because that breaks the "v0 is the maximal
deploy footprint" contract every other tooling layer relies on
(round-0 baseline include, deploy planner, dep-aware purge between
rounds, etc.).

Detection
=========
For each application with ``len(variants) > 1``:

1. Compute ``closure_v = transitive set of role IDs`` reachable from
   the application via ``run_after`` plus shared-service auto-include
   (``services.<svc>.enabled is True AND shared is True``), using
   variant ``v`` for the application's own services and variant 0 for
   every recursive dep (deps don't track the parent's variant).
2. If any non-baseline closure (``v > 0``) is NOT a subset of the
   baseline closure (``v = 0``), record the divergence as an offender.
   Empty closures trivially satisfy subset and are accepted.
