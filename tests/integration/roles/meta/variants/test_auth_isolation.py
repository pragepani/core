"""Integration guard: an **auth-isolated** variant in
``roles/<role>/meta/variants.yml`` MUST explicitly disable every
non-auth service-key that any other variant of the same role declares.

Why
---

When a variant pins exactly one auth flavor (LDAP vs. OIDC/OAuth2)
the round under test exists to exercise that one auth path. Leaving
unrelated services (matomo, prometheus, dashboard, …) unset means
their effective value is decided by the deep-merge against
``meta/services.yml`` at deploy time — usually a dynamic
``"{{ '<role>' in group_names }}"`` expression — which makes the
resolver pull every matching provider role into the round's include
closure. The auth-only test scope balloons into a full integration
deploy, wasting CI minutes and obscuring the regression signal.

Pinning every non-auth flag to ``enabled: false, shared: false`` in
the auth-isolated variant keeps the closure tight: the resolver gets
a deterministic, minimal include set and the variant clearly states
"only this auth path, nothing else." The cost is a few explicit
``false`` lines per variant; the benefit is faster, more focused
matrix rounds.

Trigger
-------

A variant V is **auth-isolated** when:

1. EXACTLY ONE of the two auth flavors is set to ``enabled: true`` in
   V's ``services:`` block:

   * LDAP flavor: ``services.ldap.enabled: true``
   * OIDC/OAuth2 flavor: ``services.oidc.enabled: true`` OR
     ``services.oauth2.enabled: true``

2. AND no non-auth service-key in V's ``services:`` block has
   ``enabled: true``.

Variants that enable both auth flavors (a full integration test), or
neither (a no-auth baseline / teardown variant), or that pin auth
alongside other ``enabled: true`` services (a mixed integration test)
are NOT auth-isolated and this rule does not fire for them.

Obligation
----------

When V is auth-isolated, every service-key K that appears in any
variant of this role's ``meta/variants.yml`` AND is not in
``{ldap, oidc, oauth2}`` MUST be declared in V as
``enabled: false`` AND ``shared: false`` (literal).

Exemption
---------

Place ``# nocheck: variants-auth-isolation`` on the same line as the
variant's leading ``- services:`` (or on the line immediately above)
to skip the check for that single variant entry.
