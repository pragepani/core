"""Lint: non-Markdown source files MUST NOT reference requirement
documents. Tokens of the shape ``req <NNN>``, ``req-<NNN>``,
``req <NNN> Rule <M>``, ``Requirement <NNN>``, ``requirement-<NNN>``,
or path references of the shape ``docs/requirements/<NNN>-<slug>.md``
are forbidden in ``.js``, ``.py``, ``.yml``, ``.yaml``, ``.j2``, and
``.sh`` files.

Why
---

Requirement files are an authoring contract enforced by lint and
integration tests. Comments anchored to requirement numbers rot
when requirements are renumbered, restructured, or rewritten, and
they conflate the *what is true now* (which the comment should
describe) with the *audit trail of how we got here* (which belongs
in commit messages, pull request descriptions, and the requirement
file itself). Code MUST describe the *why* in present-state
language; the contract enforcement lives in tests, not folklore.

The rule lives in ``docs/contributing/documentation.md`` under
"Comments".
