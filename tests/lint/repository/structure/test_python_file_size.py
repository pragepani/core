"""Lint: cap Python file length at 500 lines (production code only).

Every production ``.py`` file tracked by the repository (i.e. not
matched by ``.gitignore``) must be at most :data:`MAX_PY_LINES` lines
long. The threshold is a soft architectural cue. A file approaching
the cap is usually doing too many things and is a candidate for a
split.

Files under the top-level ``tests/`` directory are intentionally
excluded: tests cluster fixtures and parametrised cases by feature,
so length here reflects coverage breadth rather than design weight.

Per-file opt-out
----------------

A file may opt out of this cap by including a unified
``# nocheck: file-size`` marker inside the
first :data:`SCAN_LINES` lines, typically the module docstring or a
comment at the top. The opt-out is intentionally visible at the top of
the file so the cost of carrying long modules is not silently buried.
See ``docs/contributing/actions/testing/suppression.md`` for the full
marker grammar.

The walker uses the SPOT helpers in :mod:`utils.cache.files` so the
lint runs in environments where ``.git/`` is not mounted (the
``make compose-exec`` container) and stays consistent with other gitignore-
aware lint tests.
