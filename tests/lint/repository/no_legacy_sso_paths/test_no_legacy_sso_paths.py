"""Lint guard: no legacy oauth2/oidc paths in the source tree.

The SSO flavor migration collapsed ``services.oauth2.*`` and ``services.oidc.*``
into the unified ``services.sso.*`` shape and deleted
``roles/web-app-oauth2-proxy``. This test fails if any new source file
re-introduces one of those legacy strings.

Allowed islands (each line documented below):

* The requirement document itself (``docs/requirements/021-…``).
* The /tmp migration scripts produced during the migration.
* The upstream image name ``oauth2-proxy`` and the upstream config
  filename ``oauth2-proxy-keycloak.cfg`` stay as-is — they are
  upstream identifiers, not project-internal paths. The check matches
  ``services.oauth2.`` / ``services.oidc.`` (with trailing dot) so the
  literal substring ``oauth2-proxy`` is NOT triggered by the upstream
  image name.

The guard intentionally excludes binary blobs and generated artefacts.
