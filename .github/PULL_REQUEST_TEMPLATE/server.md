## Summary

Briefly describe the `web-*` change and the expected user-facing outcome.

Examples:

* Add a new `web-app-*` role
* Fix a broken login, bootstrap, or integration flow in an existing `web-*` role
* Introduce SSO or mail integration for an existing `web-*` role
* Extend bootstrap or deployment behavior for a server-facing application

## Template Type

Select the primary intent of this PR:

* [ ] **Feature** - Adds or extends server functionality
* [ ] **Fix** - Repairs broken or incorrect server behavior

---

## Affected Roles and Services

List the impacted roles and related services.

* Primary `web-*` role(s):
* Related `web-svc-*`, `sys-front-*`, `svc-db-*`, auth, mail, proxy, or storage role(s):

## Preferred Integrations

Integrate the change into the following services when possible:

* [ ] Dashboard
* [ ] Matomo
* [ ] OIDC

## Roles (optional `🧩 Subset` CI scope)

Optional. Ignored unless a maintainer applies the **🧩 Subset** label; without the label CI uses the diff-derived role set as usual. When the label is set, CI deploys **only** the roles listed here — each must be an existing `roles/<id>` directory, or the run fails. See [pipeline.md](../../docs/contributing/artefact/git/pipeline.md#subset-label-).

```yaml
roles:
  # - web-app-nextcloud
  # - web-app-matomo
  # - sys-version
```

## File Checklist

Check the relevant rows and explain intentional omissions in `Additional Notes`.

| Check | Item | When to include | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| [ ] | `README.md` | Usually | Documents role-specific usage, setup notes, and contributor context. |
| [ ] | `meta/main.yml` | Usually | Declares Ansible Galaxy info and `dependencies:`. No project-internal `run_after:` / `lifecycle:` (those live on the primary entity in `meta/services.yml`). |
| [ ] | `vars/main.yml` | Usually | Defines the shared fixed role variables as the main source of truth. |
| [ ] | `meta/services.yml` | Usually | Per-entity service config (file root IS the services map keyed by `<entity_name>`). Holds image/version, `ports.{internal,local,public}`, `run_after`/`lifecycle` on the primary entity, plus inlined per-service settings. |
| [ ] | `meta/server.yml` | Usually | Server-level config (file root IS `applications.<app>.server`). CSP, `domains`, `status_codes`, plus the per-role `networks.local.{subnet,dns_resolver}`. |
| [ ] | `meta/rbac.yml` | When the role declares RBAC | RBAC declarations (file root IS `applications.<app>.rbac`). |
| [ ] | `meta/volumes.yml` | When the role declares Compose volumes | Volumes map (file root IS the volumes map; no `compose:`/`volumes:` wrapper). |
| [ ] | `meta/schema.yml` | When the role declares credentials | Credential schema with optional `default:` field. |
| [ ] | `tasks/main.yml` | Usually | Acts as the role entry point and includes the main task flow. |
| [ ] | `templates/compose.yml.j2` | For containerized app roles | Defines the service, volume, environment, port, and network wiring. |
| [ ] | `templates/env.j2` | When the app uses environment files | Renders the app environment configuration. |
| [ ] | `templates/style.css.j2` or `files/style.css` | When the role injects custom branding or theming | Defines the role-local CSS overrides that adapt the UI to the repository design system. See [Contributing `style.css`](../../docs/contributing/artefact/files/role/style.css.md). |
| [ ] | `templates/javascript.js.j2` or `files/javascript.js` | When the role injects custom frontend behavior | Defines the role-local JavaScript that adapts UI behavior or integration glue in the browser. See [Contributing `javascript.js`](../../docs/contributing/artefact/files/role/javascript.js.md). |
| [ ] | `meta/users.yml` | When the role bootstraps users or identities | Role-local user definitions (file root IS the users map; no `users:` wrapper). |
| [ ] | `files/Dockerfile` | When a custom image is required | Provides a custom image build path. Prefer this over `Dockerfile.j2`. |
| [ ] | `templates/playwright.env.j2` | When Playwright coverage is included | Configures the Playwright test environment. See [Contributing `playwright.env.j2`](../../docs/agents/files/role/playwright.env.j2.md). |
| [ ] | `files/playwright/playwright.spec.js` | When Playwright coverage is included | Defines the Playwright login and logout test flow. See [Contributing `playwright.spec.js`](../../docs/contributing/artefact/files/role/playwright.specs.js.md). |

### Registered

| Check | Item | When to include | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| [ ] | Per-entity ports in `meta/services.yml.<entity>.ports.{internal,local,public}` | When the app exposes a service | Confirms that the app's host-bound ports are declared on the entity that exposes them. Use `cli meta ports suggest` to pick free slots inside the appropriate `PORT_BANDS.<scope>.<category>` from `group_vars/all/08_networks.yml`. |
| [ ] | Per-role subnet in `meta/server.yml.networks.local.subnet` | When the app communicates over container networks | Confirms that the role's docker network CIDR is declared. Use `cli meta networks suggest --clients N` to pick a free subnet. |
