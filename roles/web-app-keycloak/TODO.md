## Req 019 rollout: deploy gate

- During the autonomous req 019 rollout, `make compose-deploy mode=reinstall apps=web-app-keycloak full_cycle=true` failed with two unrelated assertions:
  - `kcadm.sh config credentials` failed during the keycloak admin login phase (likely transient or env-scoped).
  - `run_once_web_app_mailu is defined` assertion failed in `sys-svc-mail`, indicating the service-loader did not preload Mailu in the keycloak-only deploy path.
- These are deployment-orchestration failures, not playwright-parity failures, and were therefore deferred per the autonomy escape clause (archived req 019).
- The role's playwright lint contracts (Tests A + B + env_keys_used) are green; role-closure remains pending the orchestration fix.
