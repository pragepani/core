#
# Replaces wazuh/wazuh-certs-generator's own /entrypoint.sh (bind-mounted
# over it in templates/compose.yml.j2). The platform's shared
# ca-trust-wrapper (see docs/contributing/environment/cache.md and
# roles/sys-svc-compose/handlers/main.yml "Generate CA trust override")
# force-sets CURL_CA_BUNDLE/SSL_CERT_FILE/REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE/
# NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS to the platform's own single-cert dev CA via a compose
# override file that is always merged AFTER this role's own compose.yml, so
# an `environment:` override in compose.yml.j2 is silently clobbered
# (confirmed empirically against a live deploy). This container's original
# entrypoint downloads its cert-generation tool from the genuinely-public
# internet (packages.wazuh.com), which a single-cert CURL_CA_BUNDLE cannot
# verify. `unset` here restores curl's default trust store, which the
# wrapper's own `update-ca-trust extract` step has already populated with
# both the system's public CAs and the platform's dev CA. Everything below
# this point is an unmodified copy of the vendor's own /entrypoint.sh,
# except download_package()'s curl flags (added --connect-timeout/--max-time/
# --retry-all-errors so a transient network blip during `docker compose up`
# doesn't hang or fail outright).
