# The platform's shared CA-trust injection (compose.ca.override.yml) only
# sets CURL_CA_BUNDLE/SSL_CERT_FILE/REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE/NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS -
# none of which the JVM honours. wazuh.indexer's own OIDC authenticator
# (config.yml's openid_auth_domain) makes an outbound HTTPS call from
# inside the JVM to Keycloak's discovery/JWKS endpoint to validate ID
# tokens; without the platform's dev CA in the JVM's own cacerts keystore,
# that call fails with PKIX path building failed / AuthenticatorUnavailableException,
# which OpenSearch Security surfaces to the dashboard as a bare
# "Authentication Exception" - confirmed against a live deploy by reading
# the indexer's own stack trace. keytool import is the only fix; there is
# no env-var-based shortcut for the JVM trust store. This must run before
# the privilege-drop below, since the cacerts file is not writable by the
# unprivileged wazuh-indexer user.
#
# No hardcoded path fallback here (unlike an earlier revision): CA_TRUST_CERT
# is always set by the platform's compose.ca.override.yml when CA injection
# is active, matching the guard-only pattern already used by
# web-app-pixelfed/files/docker-entrypoint.sh and
# web-app-jenkins/files/entrypoint-with-ca.sh. This also means the container
# path this value points at (currently /tmp/infinito/ca/root-ca.crt) has no
# duplicate literal to update if the platform's own SPOT for it changes.
