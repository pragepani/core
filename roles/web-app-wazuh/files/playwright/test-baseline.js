// biber starts with no Wazuh group membership (the fixture's generic
// "regular end-user" account, deliberately blank-slate — see
// docs/contributing/artefact/files/role/playwright.specs.js.md). To give
// biber a real interaction to drive, this test grants readonly-auditor
// membership for the duration of the test only, via the Keycloak Admin
// REST API (same technique as roles/web-app-wordpress/files/playwright/
// test-rbac-roles.js), and always removes it again in `finally`.
//
// Registered via an exported function (not run at module scope) so
// playwright.spec.js can group it into the same `test.describe.serial`
// block as test-rbac-roles.js's RBAC_TIERS loop: both mutate the SAME
// Keycloak "readonly-auditor" group for the SAME "biber" user. Running
// them concurrently (PLAYWRIGHT_FULLY_PARALLEL=true with
// PLAYWRIGHT_WORKERS>1 — both worker/scheduling knobs this suite exposes)
// previously raced their independent add/remove cycles: each call sees
// "not yet a member", each adds it (harmless, idempotent) and believes it
// owns the membership, then whichever test's `finally` cleanup runs first
// revokes it out from under the other mid-flow. Serial execution removes
// the race outright instead of just narrowing its window.
