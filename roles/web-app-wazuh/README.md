# Wazuh

## Description

[Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) is an open-source SIEM and XDR platform providing security monitoring, log analysis, intrusion and vulnerability detection, and compliance support.

## Overview

This role deploys the single-node Wazuh stack (`wazuh.manager`, `wazuh.indexer`, `wazuh.dashboard`) using Docker Compose, pinned to `4.14.6` (the latest stable `wazuh-docker` tag at the time of writing, newer than the `4.14.5` originally targeted). Agent enrollment across the platform's Docker/DinD fleet is explicitly **out of scope** for this role: the agent-facing ports (`1514`, `1515`, `514/udp`) are declared in `meta/services.yml` so a follow-up role does not need to renegotiate port allocation, but they are not published or wired to any enrollment logic yet.

The indexer (an OpenSearch fork) is entirely self-contained: it is Wazuh's own datastore and also holds the OpenSearch security plugin's RBAC configuration. This role does not wire Wazuh to the platform's shared MariaDB/PostgreSQL.

## Cosmos

The diagram places Wazuh in the Infinito.Nexus cosmos: the components it deploys (capabilities), the central services it consumes (dependencies), and its outward reach (federation and bridged external networks).

## Features

- **Single-node Wazuh stack:** manager, indexer, and dashboard, TLS-bootstrapped by a genuine one-shot `wazuh-certs-generator` job (`restart: "no"`, gated via Compose's `service_completed_successfully` condition, never a persistent service).
- **Native OIDC login:** the dashboard authenticates directly against Keycloak's discovery endpoint (`http_authenticator: type: openid` in the indexer's `config.yml`) — no oauth2-proxy sidecar, following the same native pattern as `web-app-bigbluebutton`.
- **LDAP as a secondary authorization backend:** `config.dynamic.authz.ldap_authz_domain` enriches an already-OIDC-authenticated user with `backend_roles` pulled from LDAP group membership. LDAP never verifies a password here; it cannot be used as a login path.
- **Three-tier RBAC:** Administrator, Security Analyst (a genuinely custom OpenSearch role, not a stock template), and Read-only Auditor, mapped at both the indexer (OpenSearch security roles/roles_mapping) and enforced implicitly at the dashboard layer (see RBAC section below).
- **No literal secrets:** indexer admin, dashboard service account, Wazuh API, and manager cluster-key credentials are all generated via `meta/secrets.yml`, never shipped as defaults.

## Quick Setup

### Development

Clone, set up the workstation, and deploy Wazuh onto the local stack:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infinito-nexus/core.git
cd core
make onboard
make compose-deploy mode=reinstall apps=web-app-wazuh full_cycle=false
```

### Production

Run the published image to provision the inventory and deploy Wazuh to a managed server (the mounted volume persists the inventory):

```bash
APP=web-app-wazuh
HOST=<your-server>
TLS_MODE=self_signed
SSH_PUBLIC_KEY="<your-ssh-public-key>"

docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$PWD/inventories:/etc/infinito.nexus/inventories" \
  -e APP="$APP" -e HOST="$HOST" -e TLS_MODE="$TLS_MODE" -e SSH_PUBLIC_KEY="$SSH_PUBLIC_KEY" \
  ghcr.io/infinito-nexus/core/debian bash -c '
    INVENTORY=/etc/infinito.nexus/inventories/production
    infinito administration inventory provision "$INVENTORY" \
      --inventory-file "$INVENTORY/devices.yml" \
      --host "$HOST" \
      --include "$APP" \
      --vars "{\"TLS_MODE\": \"$TLS_MODE\", \"users\": {\"administrator\": {\"authorized_keys\": [\"$SSH_PUBLIC_KEY\"]}}}" &&
    infinito administration deploy dedicated "$INVENTORY/devices.yml" \
      --password-file "$INVENTORY/.password" \
      --diff -vv'
```

```

LDAP is consulted only for authorization enrichment, never to verify a password (see LDAP section below); `admin`/`kibanaserver` bypass both OIDC and LDAP entirely via `basic_internal_auth_domain`.

## Authentication: OIDC investigation

**What was tried:** native OIDC directly against Keycloak, per the decision gate in the original implementation spec. No existing role in this fork does native OIDC against Keycloak to crib from (`web-app-n8n`'s OIDC is the oauth2-proxy trusted-header pattern, a different mechanism); `web-app-bigbluebutton` (`services.sso.flavor: oidc`) is the closest structural precedent and was used as the model. The implementation:

- Indexer (`templates/config.yml.j2`): `openid_auth_domain` with `http_authenticator: type: openid`, `challenge: true`, `subject_key: {{ OIDC.ATTRIBUTES.USERNAME }}`, `roles_key: groups`, `openid_connect_url: {{ OIDC.CLIENT.DISCOVERY_DOCUMENT }}`.
- Dashboard (`templates/opensearch_dashboards.yml.j2`): `opensearch_security.auth.type: "openid"` plus the matching `connect_url`/`client_id`/`client_secret`/`base_redirect_url`/`scope`/`logout_url`, all sourced from `OIDC.CLIENT.*`.
- `basic_internal_auth_domain` stays present alongside `openid_auth_domain` so the `admin`/`kibanaserver` service accounts keep working regardless of SSO state.

**Outcome: implemented and empirically verified working end-to-end against a live deploy.** The full redirect chain (dashboard → Keycloak login → authorization code → token exchange → session) completes cleanly for both the platform's standard administrator fixture and a dynamically-group-assigned `biber` account. `roles_key: groups` correctly resolves against the `full.path=true` leading-slash shape (see the RBAC table below) — no claim-shape surprises. Getting there required fixing seven real, non-obvious bugs, all confirmed by direct log/source inspection rather than guessing:

1. **Front-proxy vhost was never wired.** The primary/metadata entity (`wazuh`) carries no ports, so `sys-stk-full` (which derives `http_port` from the acting role's own entity) can't be used; `sys-stk-front-proxy` must be included directly with `http_port` pointed at the `console` (dashboard) entity's port, the same structural reason `web-app-bluesky` does the same thing.
2. **`compose exec`/`docker compose exec` address services by their compose *service key* (`indexer`), never the `container_name` (`wazuh.indexer`)** — used incorrectly in `tasks/01_securityadmin.yml`, producing a misleading `service "wazuh.indexer" is not running` even while the container was healthy.
3. **`securityadmin.sh` hangs indefinitely without `JAVA_HOME` set explicitly** — its own `which java` fallback doesn't work in this image; the fix passes `-e JAVA_HOME=/usr/share/wazuh-indexer/jdk` on the `compose exec` invocation.
4. **The indexer's own outbound OIDC calls to Keycloak (discovery + JWKS) failed with `PKIX path building failed`.** The platform's shared CA-trust injection only sets `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`/`SSL_CERT_FILE`/`REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`/`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` — none of which the JVM's own `cacerts` keystore honours. OpenSearch Security surfaced this as a bare, unhelpful `"Authentication Exception"` on every login attempt; the real cause was only found by reading the indexer's own Java stack trace (`com.amazon.dlic.auth.http.jwt.keybyoidc.AuthenticatorUnavailableException`). Fixed by prepending a `keytool -importcert` step to a vendored copy of the indexer's own entrypoint (`files/shell/indexer-entrypoint.sh`) — there is no env-var shortcut for the JVM trust store.
5. **`authc` domain evaluation order matters**: with `openid_auth_domain` at `order: 0`, it short-circuited on any request that wasn't a Bearer token — including plain Basic-auth requests from the health check/`admin` service account — and never fell through to `basic_internal_auth_domain`. Fixed by putting `basic_internal_auth_domain` first (`order: 0`).
6. **`internal_users.yml`'s `admin` account (`backend_roles: ["admin"]`) and `kibanaserver` account (no `backend_roles` at all) both need their own `roles_mapping.yml` entries** — separate from the RBAC-group-path mappings for real human users — or they authenticate successfully and then get 403 on every request.
7. **Wazuh's own `wz-home` app throws an uncaught client-side exception during its bootstrap for any OpenSearch role other than `all_access`.** This is a genuine upstream Wazuh bug, not a permission gap on this role's side and not a test artifact: it would affect every real security-analyst/readonly-auditor end-user hitting their landing page, identically to the Playwright reproduction. Confirmed via a full network-waterfall comparison between a working administrator session and a failing `readonly-auditor` session — both follow an *identical* request sequence through `POST /api/saved_objects/_bulk_get` (200, real data, no embedded per-object errors), then the non-admin session simply stops issuing requests and OpenSearch Dashboards' core falls back to its generic "Application Not Found" page. This isn't specific to `wz-home` as a *landing* page either: a completely fresh session navigated directly to `/app/discover` first (never touching `wz-home` at all) hit the identical failure, while `/app/home` — OpenSearch Dashboards' own framework-standard page, not a Wazuh customization — rendered correctly for the same `readonly-auditor` session. `defaultRoute` (`opensearch_dashboards.yml.j2`) is therefore pointed at `/app/home` rather than `wz-home`: it has no native per-role conditionality (`schema.string()`, a single global value — confirmed by reading `src/core/server/ui_settings/settings/navigation.js` directly), so a uniform, confirmed-working landing page for every role is the real fix, not a client-side role-detection hack layered on top of a broken app. Administrators can still reach `wz-home` via in-app navigation once past this landing page; non-admin roles should be told to expect `wz-home` itself to be unusable until Wazuh fixes this upstream.

No SAML fallback was needed; the OIDC-first plan worked once these were fixed.

**Verification note:** the "empirically verified working end-to-end" claim above was originally written using `files/playwright/_shared.js`'s `wazuhLoginViaOidc` helper, whose only success check was `expect.poll(() => page.url()).toContain(host)` — trivially true even while sitting unauthenticated on OpenSearch Dashboards' own `/app/login` shell, with zero session cookies ever established (confirmed empirically: a "passing" run had `page.context().cookies()` return `[]`). The helper has since been fixed to assert a real session cookie exists after login (and to click through to Keycloak when no auto-redirect occurs), and the claim above has been re-verified against the corrected helper: all three RBAC tiers (`administrator`, `security-analyst`, `readonly-auditor`) pass `files/playwright/test-rbac-roles.js` with genuine authenticated sessions.

## LDAP

LDAP (`svc-db-openldap`) is wired as a **secondary, authorization-only** backend, independent of whichever mechanism handles login:

- `config.dynamic.authz.ldap_authz_domain` (`templates/config.yml.j2`) has `authorization_backend: type: ldap` and **no** `authentication_backend` — it is consulted only to enrich the already-authenticated user's `backend_roles` from LDAP group membership.
- Every LDAP-side value is sourced from `LDAP.*` (never hardcoded): `LDAP.SERVER.URI` (scheme stripped, since OpenSearch's LDAP module wants a bare `host:port`), `LDAP.SERVER.SECURITY` (drives `enable_ssl`/`enable_start_tls`), `LDAP.DN.ADMINISTRATOR.DATA`/`LDAP.BIND_CREDENTIAL` (bind), `LDAP.DN.OU.USERS`/`LDAP.DN.OU.ROLES` (search bases), `LDAP.USER.ATTRIBUTES.ID` (login attribute).
- The one deliberate deviation from the canonical `LDAP.FILTERS.USERS.LOGIN` filter: OpenSearch's LDAP module hardcodes its own `{0}`-subject placeholder syntax, incompatible with that filter's `%uid` placeholder, so the search filter is built from `LDAP.USER.ATTRIBUTES.ID` directly instead.
- `skip_users: [admin, kibanaserver]` so the two internal service accounts don't trigger LDAP lookups.

## RBAC

RBAC roles are declared in `meta/rbac.yml` and consumed exclusively through the platform's `rbac_group_path` lookup — **no ad-hoc Keycloak client scope or literal-named LDAP/Keycloak groups were created for this role.**

| Required role | Indexer-level OpenSearch role | `backend_roles` (OIDC shape) | `backend_roles` (LDAP shape) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Administrator | `all_access` (built-in) | `/roles/web-app-wazuh/administrator` | `web-app-wazuh-administrator` |
| Security Analyst | `security_analyst` (custom, `templates/roles.yml.j2`: read-only over `wazuh-alerts-*`/`wazuh-archives-*`/`wazuh-monitoring-*`/`wazuh-statistics-*`, no security-index or admin actions) | `/roles/web-app-wazuh/security-analyst` | `web-app-wazuh-security-analyst` |
| Read-only Auditor | `readonly_auditor` (custom, `files/roles.yml`: `read` action group over all indices, no writes) + `kibana_read_only` (built-in, harmless/inert here — see Developer Notes) | `/roles/web-app-wazuh/readonly-auditor` | `web-app-wazuh-readonly-auditor` |

Each `roles_mapping.yml` entry lists **both** shapes because OIDC (Keycloak `groups` claim, `full.path=true`) and LDAP (CN pattern `<application_id>-<role_name>` per `docs/contributing/design/iam/rbac.md`'s LDAP layout contract) produce different strings for the same conceptual role; either can enrich a user's `backend_roles`, so both must be listed.

The Security Analyst role's inability to reach the OpenSearch Dashboards Security app (internal users, roles, role mappings) is **not** separately wired — it falls out naturally from the role's OpenSearch permissions: OpenSearch Dashboards itself only renders/allows that app for roles carrying cluster-admin security actions, which `security_analyst` deliberately does not have. `files/playwright/test-rbac-roles.js` verifies this is a real, live UI-level effect (direct navigation + DOM assertion) rather than an inference from the permission definitions.

A *positive* "security-analyst has write actions somewhere" UI check was deliberately **not** added: Wazuh's agent-management views only render mutating controls (restart/upgrade/delete/edit) for enrolled agents, and agent enrollment is explicitly out of scope for this role, so that check would be untestable in this environment regardless of role. A read-only-mode UI banner was considered as an agent-independent alternative, but OpenSearch Dashboards' own `ReadonlyService` (`server/readonly/readonly_service.js`, confirmed by reading the file directly inside the running container) only activates when multitenancy is enabled, and this role runs with `opensearch_security.multitenancy.enabled: false` — so no such banner exists to check here.

**Auth cache is disabled (`plugins.security.cache.ttl_minutes: 0`, `templates/wazuh.indexer.yml.j2`).** OpenSearch Security's default 60-minute auth cache resolves a user's `backend_roles` once and reuses them by username for the cache lifetime, independent of subsequent logins with an updated token — confirmed via manual testing: after changing a test user's Keycloak group membership (verified correct both in Keycloak and in a freshly-issued token's `groups` claim), the dashboard kept serving the *previous*, more-permissive role set even after a full logout/login in a private browser window, until the indexer's cache was flushed (`DELETE _plugins/_security/api/cache`). For a SIEM's RBAC, prompt revocation matters more than the auth-latency cost of disabling caching at this deployment's scale, so it's disabled outright rather than shortened.

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

`meta/csp.yml` grants `script-src-elem` `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` and `worker-src: blob:` for this role. The `worker-src: blob:` grant is **confirmed required, via reproducible live testing** — not a guess: `files/playwright/test-csp.js` drives the OpenSearch Dashboards Dev Tools console (Ace-editor-based), the route most likely to spawn a Web Worker from a `blob:` URL. Without the grant, three consecutive live runs against the deployed dashboard produced an identical, reproducible browser-level block (`Creating a worker from 'blob:...' violates ... "worker-src 'self'". The action has been blocked.`). After adding the grant, three consecutive live runs produced zero CSP violations (`cspRelated: []`, `consoleErrors: []`). This is a `whitelist` entry, not a `flags` boolean: `plugins/filter/csp_filters.py`'s `get_csp_flags` quotes its keys (`'blob'` is not valid CSP syntax for a scheme source), while `get_csp_whitelist` appends list entries verbatim — the same mechanism 10+ other roles (`web-app-nextcloud`, `web-app-gitea`, `web-app-mastodon`, etc.) already use for the identical grant.

**Known, unresolved issue: the Dev Tools console editor cannot be reliably clicked into via Playwright, for reasons unrelated to CSP.** The same live testing that confirmed the `worker-src: blob:` grant above also surfaced two separate UI blockers on the path to actually typing a query:

1. A first-visit "Welcome to Console" tour dialog (an EUI overlay mask) sits on top of the editor and blocks any click until dismissed — worked around in `test-csp.js` by dismissing it first.
2. Even after dismissing that dialog, Ace's own internal `.ace_content` div (inside `.ace_scroller`) intercepts the click on the underlying `.ace_text-input` textarea — confirmed via a live DOM snapshot captured at the point of failure. This is a rendering quirk internal to the Ace editor itself, not a CSP or dismiss-dialog issue, and was not investigated further (same category of accepted, documented limitation as the `wz-home` bootstrap bug under "Authentication: OIDC investigation" above).

Because of this, `test-csp.js` treats the console-typing step as a **logged observation, not a hard assertion**: a bounded per-action click timeout (10s) lets a failed click be caught and reported quickly rather than consuming the whole test budget, so the test's actual, hard-asserted verdict (`expectNoCspViolations`) reflects only what was actually proven — that `worker-src: blob:` eliminates the CSP violation — independent of whether the click-through itself succeeds.

## Tor / Onion Reachability

`meta/services.yml` declares a `tor:` block with `exclusive: false`, an explicit override of the `svc-net-tor` provider's own default (`exclusive: true`, which most consuming roles inherit unmodified). Without this override, the moment an operator deploys `svc-net-tor` anywhere on the platform, Wazuh's clearnet vhost (`wazuh.{{ DOMAIN_PRIMARY }}`) would be silently **replaced** by its onion address rather than staying reachable alongside it (see `utils/cache/domains.py`'s `_inject_onion_domains`, and the passing unit test `tests/unit/python/utils/cache/test_domains.py::TestOnionDomainInjection::test_exclusive_primary_default_from_provider`, which asserts exactly that default). Wazuh is a security-monitoring/incident-response tool: losing guaranteed clearnet access to the dashboard as a side effect of an unrelated Tor deployment elsewhere is an operational risk specific to this kind of app, unlike a general-purpose SSO app where onion-only is an acceptable trade-off. `exclusive: false` keeps Wazuh dual-stack (clearnet **and** onion, when Tor is deployed) instead.

**Known, unresolved limitation: the onion vhost is not currently registered with the front proxy, so the dual-stack intent above is not yet fully realized.** `roles/sys-stk-front-proxy/tasks/main.yml`'s `sys-front-tls` inclusion and `roles/sys-front-tls/templates/nginx_ssl_header.j2`'s `lookup('tls', ...)` calls are keyed on `application_id`, not on the specific `domain` being registered. That is harmless for every pre-existing role, since a single-domain app's `application_id` and its one `domain` always resolve to the same TLS state — but Wazuh registering a *second* `sys-stk-front-proxy` inclusion for its onion domain (alongside the existing clearnet one) would resolve TLS enablement for that second, onion vhost from the app's primary (clearnet) domain instead of its own, giving the onion vhost a `listen 443 ssl` it cannot use (Tor's SOCKS circuit connects in plaintext on 80) and breaking with a 404. This was confirmed against a live deploy while investigating this role, but it is a **platform-level** limitation in `sys-stk-front-proxy`/`sys-front-tls`, not specific to Wazuh: any future multi-domain app would hit the identical bug. Fixing it means keying those `lookup('tls', ...)` calls on `domain` instead of `application_id`, which touches shared roles consumed by all 100+ apps on the platform and is out of scope for this role's PR — it should land as its own dedicated platform-level PR. Until then, `tasks/00_core.yml` includes `sys-stk-front-proxy` once, for the clearnet domain only; the onion address is provisioned (DNS/onion service, per `svc-net-tor`) but not fronted by nginx.

## Bootstrap

1. `vm.max_map_count=262144` (OpenSearch requirement) is set via a host-level `ansible.posix.sysctl` pre-task, skipped only when Ansible itself runs inside a DinD sandbox. There is no per-container Compose fallback: Docker/runc rejects a `sysctls:` override for a non-namespaced parameter (confirmed against a live deploy), so a DinD sandbox deploy may see the indexer fail to boot on an under-provisioned host, the same accepted limitation as `svc-runner`'s inotify tuning.
2. `wazuh-certs-generator` runs as a genuine one-shot Compose service (`restart: "no"`), gated via `service_completed_successfully` so manager/indexer never start before certs exist.
3. The indexer's cluster health is polled (`uri_retry`, real retries, no `ignore_errors`) until `green`/`yellow` before `securityadmin.sh` applies `internal_users.yml`/`config.yml`/`roles.yml`/`roles_mapping.yml` to the security index.

## Developer Notes

The `wazuh.dashboard` compose entity is named `console` in `meta/services.yml` (not `dashboard`): the file root already uses `dashboard` for the platform's `web-app-dashboard` tile-integration service bond, and reusing it for the compose entity silently dropped that bond's `enabled`/`shared` flags during development (a real YAML top-level key collision, caught and fixed before this PR). See `meta/services.yml` and `vars/main.yml` for the full explanation.

The manager/indexer/dashboard container names are **dotted** (`wazuh.manager`, `wazuh.indexer`, `wazuh.dashboard`), not hyphenated, matching upstream's own single-node naming exactly. This is load-bearing, not cosmetic: `wazuh-certs-tool.sh`'s own SAN-validation regex requires a dot followed by a 2+ letter suffix to accept a value as a DNS name at all; a hyphenated name like `wazuh-manager` fails that regex and the tool aborts with `Invalid IP or DNS` (confirmed against a live deploy).

The `wazuh-certs-generator` service bind-mounts a replacement `/entrypoint.sh` (`files/shell/certs-entrypoint.sh`, an unmodified copy of the vendor script plus one `unset` line and a `--connect-timeout`/`--max-time`/`--retry-all-errors` addition to its own `curl` download) over the image's own entrypoint. The platform's shared CA-trust injection (`compose.ca.override.yml`, generated per `roles/sys-svc-compose/handlers/main.yml`) force-sets `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`/`SSL_CERT_FILE`/`REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`/`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` to the platform's own single-cert dev CA and is always merged **after** this role's `compose.yml`, so an `environment:` override in `templates/compose.yml.j2` is silently clobbered (confirmed empirically). This container needs the opposite: it downloads its cert-generation tool from the genuinely-public internet (`packages.wazuh.com`) at startup, which a single-cert bundle cannot verify. Volumes merge as a list rather than a per-key override, so a bind-mounted replacement entrypoint is the one lever that override file does not reach.

There is no per-container fallback for `vm.max_map_count`: Docker/runc rejects a `sysctls:` override for a parameter that is not namespaced (confirmed against a live deploy: `sysctl "vm.max_map_count" is not in a separate kernel namespace`). The host-level `ansible.posix.sysctl` task in `tasks/00_core.yml` is the only real mechanism; see Bootstrap above.

`kibana_read_only` stays mapped to the readonly-auditor's backend_roles alongside the custom `readonly_auditor` role, but it is inert for UI purposes in this deployment: OpenSearch Dashboards' own `ReadonlyService` (`server/readonly/readonly_service.js`, confirmed by reading the file directly inside the running container) only activates `readonly_mode.roles` when multitenancy is enabled, and this role runs with `opensearch_security.multitenancy.enabled: false`. It is kept mapped anyway in case some other, non-UI mechanism keys off it, since doing so costs nothing.

The indexer's own `/entrypoint.sh` is likewise replaced (`files/shell/indexer-entrypoint.sh`, an unmodified copy of the vendor script with a `keytool -importcert` step prepended) for the same class of reason as the certs-generator's: the indexer's JVM makes its own outbound HTTPS calls to Keycloak (for OIDC discovery/JWKS) that the platform's env-var-based CA-trust injection cannot reach, since Java maintains its own separate `cacerts` trust store. See "Authentication: OIDC investigation" above for the exact failure this fixes.

The Docker healthcheck and the Ansible-level wait_for gate on the indexer intentionally accept a bare `401` as "healthy"/"reachable", not just `200`: `securityadmin.sh` (which pushes this role's own credentials into the security index) only runs *after* these checks pass, so gating them on the role's own admin password would be a chicken-and-egg deadlock that never resolves (confirmed against a live deploy). A separate, later task re-checks the real credentials after `securityadmin.sh` has run.

**Playwright coverage in V1 (sso off):** the `administrator` persona is blocked (`PERSONA_ADMINISTRATOR_BLOCKED=true` in `templates/playwright.env.j2`) because the dashboard has no form-based fallback in this shape — auth falls back to the internal `admin`/`kibanaserver` HTTP-basic accounts only, which the generic admin persona helper cannot drive. The `biber` RBAC scenario (`files/playwright/test-baseline.js`) and the RBAC-tier suite (`files/playwright/test-rbac-roles.js`) both skip via `skipUnlessServiceEnabled("sso")`, since their own Keycloak group-membership setup has no IdP to call against when V1 deploys no Keycloak at all. `playwright.spec.js` registers both inside one `test.describe.serial` block: they mutate the same Keycloak groups for the same `biber` user, so running them concurrently under `PLAYWRIGHT_FULLY_PARALLEL` would race their independent add/remove cycles.
