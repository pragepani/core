# Role Loop

Use this page for iterating on a local app deploy during role-level debugging or development.
For spec-level inner-loop iteration, see [Playwright Spec Loop](playwright.md).
For workflow-level iteration with Act, see [Workflow Loop](workflow.md).

## Rules

- Before starting the loop, you MUST propose disabling all non-necessary services via `INFINITO_SERVICES_DISABLED` to reduce resource usage. In the typical case, this means keeping only the database and disabling everything else. Only proceed without this proposal if the user has already confirmed a full-stack setup.
- Non-essential provider toggle:
  - WHEN: before first deploy of iteration.
  - ACTION: ask user "disable matomo, dashboard, prometheus, email, css providers? [Y/n]".
  - DEFAULT: yes (disable all five).
  - SKIP ASK: only if user already answered explicitly in this iteration.
  - ON YES: pass `INFINITO_SERVICES_DISABLED="matomo,dashboard,prometheus,email,css"` verbatim to every deploy command. The value is a comma-separated list of provider keys, NOT a glob, NOT a `web-app-*.services.*` path.
  - ON NO: omit the variable entirely.
  - SIDE EFFECT (yes): inventory initializer auto-removes the provider roles `web-app-matomo`, `web-app-dashboard`, `web-app-prometheus`, `web-app-mailu`, and `web-svc-css`. Do NOT list them in `INFINITO_APPS`.
  - PERSIST: record answer at top of iteration. Reuse for all subsequent deploys without re-asking.
- You MUST run `make test` before every deploy. Only proceed with the deploy if all tests pass.
- You MUST prepend `INFINITO_PLAYWRIGHT_KEEP=true` to every `make compose-deploy` command in the iteration (any mode), so trace, screenshot, and video of passing Playwright tests stay inspectable. Omit only when the user has explicitly opted out of per-test artefacts. For the full propagation chain see [Playwright Tests](../../../contributing/actions/testing/playwright.md#artefact-retention-).
- Unless the user explicitly says to reuse the existing setup, you MUST start once with `make compose-deploy mode=reinstall apps=<roles> full_cycle=true` to establish the baseline inventory and clean app state. `full_cycle=true` adds the async update pass (pass 2) and MUST stay on unless the user explicitly asks to skip it.
- You MUST NOT run more than one deploy command at the same time. Deployments MUST be executed serially, never in parallel.
- To speed up debugging, you MAY pass multiple apps at once, e.g. `make compose-deploy mode=reinstall apps="<roles> <roles>" full_cycle=true`.
- After that, you MUST use `make compose-deploy mode=update apps=<roles>` for the default edit-fix-redeploy loop.
- Do NOT rerun `make compose-deploy mode=reinstall apps=<roles> full_cycle=true` just because a deploy failed or you changed code. That restarts the stack unnecessarily and burns time.
- If the same failure still reproduces on the reuse path and you want to test whether app entity state is involved, use `make compose-deploy mode=update apps=<roles> purge=true` once.
- After that targeted purge check, you MUST return to `make compose-deploy mode=update apps=<roles>`.
- Only go back to `make compose-deploy mode=reinstall apps=<roles> full_cycle=true` if you have concrete evidence that the inventory or host stack is broken, or you intentionally need a fresh single-app baseline again.
- Network or DNS failures during a local deploy count as concrete evidence that the host stack is broken. In that case, the next retry MUST be `make compose-deploy mode=reinstall apps=<roles> full_cycle=true`.
- If you need to validate the single-app init/deploy path separately, use `make compose-deploy apps=<roles>`.

## Matrix variants

For the matrix-variant mechanism (folder layout, round semantics, `--variant` / `--full-cycle` flags) see [variants.md](../../../contributing/design/variants.md). The agent-side iteration rules below assume that mechanism as background.

- Before you start a Role Loop on a matrix-variant role, you MUST decide if the iteration targets the FULL matrix (validates every variant) or ONE specific variant (focused debug). State the choice explicitly before the first deploy.
- For focused debug on variant `<idx>`, you MUST pin `INFINITO_VARIANT=<idx>` on every command in the iteration. Mixing pinned and unpinned commands silently retargets a different folder.
- Default focused-debug recipe: `INFINITO_VARIANT=<idx> make compose-deploy mode=reinstall apps=<role> full_cycle=true` once for the variant baseline, then `INFINITO_VARIANT=<idx> make compose-deploy mode=update apps=<role>` for the edit-fix-redeploy loop.
- First contact with a previously-untouched `INFINITO_VARIANT=<idx>` MUST be `make compose-deploy mode=reinstall apps=<roles> INFINITO_VARIANT=<idx>`, never a reuse target. Reuse re-pins the live stack onto stale volumes, DB rows and network aliases from the previously-pinned variant, producing split-brain app state.
- If a reuse target aborts with "inventory not found", you MUST add `INFINITO_VARIANT=<idx>` and re-run; do NOT work around the error by re-creating the unsuffixed folder by hand.
- For FULL-matrix iteration, omit `INFINITO_VARIANT=`. If any round fails, capture WHICH round was the last successful one so the next redeploy can pin `INFINITO_VARIANT=<that-idx>` to it.
- When debugging cross-variant interaction (for example "the multisite variant breaks because single-site state was not purged"), reproduce with the FULL matrix once, then pin `INFINITO_VARIANT=<failing-idx>` and iterate the fix. Re-run the FULL matrix only when you believe the fix is complete.

## Certificate Authority

- If the website uses locally deployed certificates, you MUST run `make network-trust-ca` before you inspect it in a browser. Otherwise the browser will warn about the local CA and the inspection will not be reliable.
- After `make network-trust-ca`, you MUST restart the browser so it picks up the updated trust store.
- If `make network-trust-ca` fails due to missing root permissions, you MUST use the alternative syntax `curl -k` (or `wget --no-check-certificate`) to skip certificate validation when checking URLs from the command line instead of fixing the trust store.

## Inspect

- Before you redeploy, you MUST complete all available inspections first. Check the live local output, local logs, and current browser state so the original state stays visible.
- To inspect files or run commands inside a running container, use `make compose-exec`.
- To run a one-off sidecar image against the same docker daemon (e.g. a Playwright runner with a patched `.env`), use `make compose-inner-run IMAGE=<ref> [INFINITO_CMD=...] [INFINITO_RUN_FLAGS=...]`.
- When a local deploy fails, you SHOULD first inspect and, where practical, validate a fix inside the running container with `make compose-exec` / `make compose-inner-run` before starting another deploy. Use that live investigation to identify the concrete root cause and save iteration time.
- Once the root cause is understood, you MUST apply the real fix in the repository files and then continue the redeploy loop with the usual commands from this page. In-container fixes are only for diagnosis or short validation and MUST NOT replace the repo change.
