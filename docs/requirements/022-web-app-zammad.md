# 022 - Zammad Helpdesk Role with OIDC SSO

## User Story

As a platform administrator of Infinito.Nexus, I want Zammad integrated into Infinito.Nexus as a `web-app-zammad` role with OpenID Connect identity provider integration so that users can access the helpdesk through the same Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism used across the Infinito.Nexus ecosystem.

## Background

Zammad is an open-source helpdesk / ticketing system. Upstream provides an official Docker Compose deployment ([docker-compose.html](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/install/docker-compose.html)) composed of the Zammad app (Rails), a Nginx fronting container, Sidekiq workers, a WebSocket service, a Zammad init container, plus four data-plane dependencies: **PostgreSQL**, **Elasticsearch**, **Redis**, **Memcached**.

Three of those dependencies have a central Infinito.Nexus service equivalent — [`svc-db-postgres`](../../roles/svc-db-postgres/), [`svc-db-redis`](../../roles/svc-db-redis/), [`svc-db-memcached`](../../roles/svc-db-memcached/) — and MUST be reused per the central-service convention. Elasticsearch has no central equivalent today and is bundled inside the role.

Zammad ships a native OmniAuth OpenIDConnect strategy. The integration uses Zammad's own OIDC client against the Infinito Keycloak IdP — no `oauth2-proxy` sidecar. The role therefore uses the `services.oidc.*` flavor (not `services.oauth2.*`).

## Confirmed Decisions

These eleven decisions were confirmed by the operator before the requirement was written and are NOT subject to re-litigation during implementation.

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Canonical hostname: `helpdesk.infinito.example`. Server-name alias: `zammad.helpdesk.infinito.example`. Both names serve the same vhost (true server-name alias in `sys-svc-proxy`), no 301 redirect. | Operator-specified; aligns with the existing alias pattern used by other dual-named roles. |
| 2 | SSO flavor is **OIDC-direct** (`services.oidc.{enabled,shared}`), NOT oauth2-proxy. The role uses Zammad's built-in OmniAuth OpenIDConnect strategy. | Zammad supports OIDC natively; an oauth2-proxy sidecar would be redundant. |
| 3 | Use the **legacy** `services.oidc.*` / `services.oauth2.*` schema (pre-[021](021-sso-flavor-migration.md)). Do NOT depend on [021](021-sso-flavor-migration.md) being merged. After 021 lands, this role is swept by the same migration like every other role. | Operator-specified; 021 is in flight and this work must not block on it. |
| 4 | The Keycloak OIDC client for Zammad is **auto-provisioned** via `web-app-keycloak`, consistent with every other OIDC-consuming role in the repo. | No manual operator step on deploy. |
| 5 | Keycloak group → Zammad role mapping is in scope **if Zammad's OIDC strategy supports group claims natively**. Target mapping: `roles/web-app-zammad/administrator` → Zammad `Admin`, `roles/web-app-zammad/agent` → Zammad `Agent`, default → Zammad `Customer`. If group-claim mapping is not configurable from outside (i.e. would require a Zammad plugin), document the limitation in the role README and leave default `Customer` for all OIDC logins. | Operator-specified ("wenn möglich"). |
| 6 | Image strategy: **upstream `ghcr.io/zammad/zammad`** (the official image from [docker-compose.html](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/install/docker-compose.html)), pinned to the **latest stable semver** in `meta/services.yml` (no `:latest`, no `:edge`). Bump path follows the same convention as other upstream-pinned roles. | Operator-specified ("upstream, mit semvers"). Self-built image (à la [015 Moodle](README.md#archive)) explicitly out of scope. |
| 7 | External-service reuse: `svc-db-postgres` for PostgreSQL, `svc-db-redis` for Redis, `svc-db-memcached` for Memcached. **Elasticsearch is bundled inside the role's compose stack** because no central `svc-db-elasticsearch` role exists. | Operator-specified ("use the central services when available"); bundling Elasticsearch is the only path until a central role exists. |
| 8 | Email integration is in scope: SMTP outbound (notifications) via `sys-svc-mail-smtp` / `web-app-mailu`, IMAP/POP3 inbound (mail-to-ticket) auto-wired when `web-app-mailu` is in `group_names`. The first inbound channel is auto-created against the Zammad-owned mailbox provisioned in Mailu. | Operator-specified ("ja"). |
| 9 | The Zammad setup wizard is **bypassed** on first deploy via auto-bootstrap (env-vars + post-start API call from the role's `tasks/`), so a fresh deploy produces a ready-to-use Zammad instance with no manual UI step. | Operator-specified ("bypass"). |
| 10 | Playwright coverage per [019](019-playwright-meta-services-parity.md): both `biber` and `administrator` personas ship as part of THIS requirement (not deferred). | Operator-specified ("include"). |
| 11 | `meta/variants.yml` defines three variants, mirroring the [`web-app-kix`](../../roles/web-app-kix/meta/variants.yml) pattern: (V1) `oidc` + `ldap` both enabled, (V2) all dynamic services flags `false` (no SSO, no LDAP, no central deps that are toggleable), (V3) `ldap` only (LDAP enabled, OIDC disabled). | Operator-specified. The order V1 / V2 / V3 matches the existing kix `meta/variants.yml` ordering. |

```

### Reverse-proxy aliases (Decision #1)

The vhost served by `sys-svc-proxy` MUST resolve  to the upstream:

| Name | Role |
|---|---|
| `zammad.helpdesk.infinito.example` | server-name alias |

Implementation follows the existing aliases pattern (no new mechanism required). Both names share one TLS certificate (SAN list contains both) and one upstream block.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Routing & TLS

- [ ] `helpdesk.infinito.example` resolves through `sys-svc-proxy` to the Zammad upstream and returns HTTP 200 on `GET /` with a Zammad-served HTML body.
- [ ] `zammad.helpdesk.infinito.example` serves the **same** Zammad vhost (true server-name alias, NOT a 301 redirect — verified by `curl -sI -H 'Host: zammad.helpdesk.infinito.example' https://<ip>/` returning `200`, not `301`).
- [ ] One TLS certificate covers both names (SAN list contains both).

### Role layout & image

- [ ] `roles/web-app-zammad/` exists with the layout in the [Target Schema](#role-layout) above.
- [ ] `meta/services.yml` pins `ghcr.io/zammad/zammad` to a concrete stable semver (no `:latest`, no `:edge`).
- [ ] `meta/services.yml` pins the bundled `docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch` image to the Elasticsearch major required by the pinned Zammad version.
- [ ] `meta/info.yml`, `meta/server.yml`, `meta/main.yml`, `meta/schema.yml` exist and pass the repo's standard role-meta lint (per [008](008-role-meta-layout.md)).

### Central-service reuse (Decision #7)

- [ ] When `svc-db-postgres` is in `group_names`, Zammad uses it as its primary database (no role-internal postgres container is spawned).
- [ ] When `svc-db-redis` is in `group_names`, Zammad uses it for Sidekiq + WebSocket (no role-internal redis container is spawned).
- [ ] When `svc-db-memcached` is in `group_names`, Zammad uses it as the Rails cache store (no role-internal memcached container is spawned).
- [ ] Elasticsearch is bundled in the role's compose stack. Documented in `roles/web-app-zammad/README.md` as a known deviation, with a forward pointer ("when a central `svc-db-elasticsearch` role exists, sweep this role to consume it").

### SSO / OIDC

- [ ] When `web-app-keycloak` is in `group_names`, a Keycloak OIDC client for Zammad is auto-provisioned via the `web-app-keycloak` role (no manual operator step).
- [ ] Zammad's OmniAuth OpenIDConnect strategy is wired to that client (issuer, client ID, client secret, redirect URI) via auto-bootstrap (env-vars or post-start API call, per Decision #9).
- [ ] End-to-end login: a fresh user signs in at `helpdesk.infinito.example` via the SSO button, lands authenticated in Zammad, and the resulting Zammad user record is auto-created with the email + display name from the OIDC `id_token`.
- [ ] **Group mapping (Decision #5)**: if Zammad's OIDC strategy can consume group claims without a plugin, Keycloak groups map to Zammad roles per the mapping in Decision #5 (Admin / Agent / Customer). If not, the limitation is documented in `roles/web-app-zammad/README.md` and all OIDC logins default to `Customer`.

### LDAP (V3 variant + V1 dual)

- [ ] When `svc-db-openldap` is in `group_names` AND OIDC is disabled (variant V3), Zammad's LDAP integration is auto-configured against the central LDAP and users authenticate against it.
- [ ] When both are in `group_names` (variant V1), the role deploys cleanly. If Zammad cannot run OIDC and LDAP simultaneously without conflict, the role MUST configure OIDC as primary and document the LDAP-passthrough mode it falls back to in `roles/web-app-zammad/README.md`.

### Email (Decision #8)

- [ ] When `web-app-mailu` is in `group_names`, Zammad's outbound channel is auto-configured to use `sys-svc-mail-smtp` (or the upstream `web-app-mailu` SMTP endpoint, whichever is the central convention for outbound SMTP) so password-reset / notification emails leave the box.
- [ ] When `web-app-mailu` is in `group_names`, a Zammad inbound mail channel is auto-created against the Zammad-owned mailbox provisioned in Mailu. Mail sent to that address arrives in Zammad as a ticket within ≤ 60s.
- [ ] When `web-app-mailu` is NOT in `group_names`, the role deploys cleanly without email; outbound goes to the `null` channel and no inbound channel is created.

### First-admin bootstrap (Decision #9)

- [ ] A fresh deploy on a clean volume produces a ready-to-use Zammad instance: NO setup wizard is presented at `helpdesk.infinito.example/#getting_started`; visiting `/#login` shows the login form directly.
- [ ] An admin user is seeded (email derived from the role's standard admin-bootstrap convention; password from the role's standard secret-bootstrap convention). The admin can log in via local credentials as a break-glass path even when OIDC is unavailable.

### Variants (Decision #11)

- [ ] `meta/variants.yml` defines exactly three variants in this order: V1 oidc+ldap, V2 all-false, V3 ldap-only.
- [ ] All three variants deploy cleanly on a fresh box (`make deploy-fresh-purged-apps INFINITO_FULL_CYCLE=true` succeeds end-to-end for each).

### Playwright (Decision #10, per [019](019-playwright-meta-services-parity.md))

- [ ] `roles/web-app-zammad/files/playwright/biber/` contains the biber-persona spec, exercising a customer-style "sign in via SSO and create a ticket" path.
- [ ] `roles/web-app-zammad/files/playwright/administrator/` contains the administrator-persona spec, exercising an "open admin panel after SSO" path.
- [ ] Both specs gate on `SSO_SERVICE_ENABLED` / `LDAP_SERVICE_ENABLED` etc. per the standard `service-gating.js` helper, so they skip-correctly under variant V2.
- [ ] `templates/playwright.env.j2` emits the standard service-flag set per [019 Rule 6](019-playwright-meta-services-parity.md).

### Health & quality

- [ ] Zammad's compose stack is healthy on a fresh deploy: every container reports `healthy` (or, if upstream ships no healthcheck for that image, no `Restarting` loop within 5 min of `up`).
- [ ] No `ERROR` / `FATAL` log lines in any Zammad container in the first 5 min after `up`, except known-benign upstream noise documented in `roles/web-app-zammad/README.md`.
- [ ] `make test` is green tree-wide (the role passes role-meta lints, services contract lints, and any new playwright-services-parity lints).

### Documentation

- [ ] `roles/web-app-zammad/README.md` documents: image source + bump policy, the bundled-Elasticsearch deviation, the OIDC group-mapping resolution (configured vs. documented limitation), the variant matrix, and the wizard-bypass bootstrap path.
- [ ] This requirement file is cross-linked from the implementing PR (per [docs/contributing/requirements.md#cross-linking](../contributing/requirements.md#cross-linking)).

## Validation Apps

The role MUST deploy cleanly under all three variants on a fresh box. The OIDC variant + LDAP variant additionally MUST pass the biber + administrator Playwright personas.

```bash
INFINITO_APPS="web-app-zammad" \
  make deploy-fresh-purged-apps INFINITO_FULL_CYCLE=true
```

End-to-end smoke after deploy:

1. Visit `https://helpdesk.infinito.example/` — Zammad login page renders, no wizard.
2. Visit `https://zammad.helpdesk.infinito.example/` — same page (server-name alias).
3. Click the SSO button — Keycloak login flow completes, user lands authenticated in Zammad.
4. (V1 / mail variant) Send an email to the Zammad-owned mailbox in Mailu — within 60s a new ticket appears under the configured group.

## Prerequisites

Before starting any implementation work, the agent MUST read [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) and follow all instructions in it.

## Implementation Strategy

The agent MUST execute this requirement **autonomously**. Open clarifications only when a decision is genuinely ambiguous and would otherwise block progress; default to the intent already captured in this document and proceed. Avoid back-and-forth questions on choices already resolved in [Confirmed Decisions](#confirmed-decisions).

1. Read [Role Loop](../agents/action/iteration/role.md) before starting.
2. Scaffold the role using `roles/web-app-kix/` as the structural template (closest analogue: helpdesk-shaped, OIDC/LDAP variants, central-service consumer pattern).
3. Wire the upstream `ghcr.io/zammad/zammad` image into the compose template, plus the bundled Elasticsearch container.
4. Implement the wizard-bypass bootstrap in `tasks/main.yml`.
5. Add Keycloak client auto-provisioning in `web-app-keycloak` for the new Zammad consumer.
6. Add the biber + administrator Playwright specs.
7. Iterate `make test` until green, then run the Validation deploys.

## Commit Policy

- The agent MUST NOT create any git commit until every Acceptance Criterion in this document is checked off (`- [x]`).
- A single commit (or a tight, related sequence) lands the whole role addition; no half-scaffolded intermediate commits.
- When all ACs are met, `make test` is green, and the three variants deploy cleanly, the agent instructs the operator to run `git-sign-push` outside the sandbox (per [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)). The agent MUST NOT push.
