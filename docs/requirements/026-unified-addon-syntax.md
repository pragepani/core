# 026 - Unified Addon Syntax

## User Story

As a contributor to Infinito.Nexus, I want every role that ships application-level extensions to declare them through one unified `meta/addons.yml` contract, instead of today's per-app spelling (`addons`, `plugins`, `extensions`, `modules`, `mu_plugins`) scattered across `meta/services.yml`, `vars/main.yml`, and `tasks/`, so that addons are discoverable, lintable, and testable with a single schema, and so that any addon that bridges into another role declares that dependency explicitly through a service flag in `meta/services.yml`.

## Background

The repository already deploys role-level extension units, but each role spells the same concept differently and stores it in a different place:

- [web-app-friendica](../../roles/web-app-friendica/) calls them `addons` and inlines them under `friendica.addons` in [meta/services.yml](../../roles/web-app-friendica/meta/services.yml).
- [web-app-odoo](../../roles/web-app-odoo/) calls them `modules` (split `core` / `optional`) under `odoo.modules` in [meta/services.yml](../../roles/web-app-odoo/meta/services.yml).
- [web-app-nextcloud](../../roles/web-app-nextcloud/) calls them `plugins` and keeps one file per plugin under [vars/plugins/](../../roles/web-app-nextcloud/vars/plugins/).
- [web-app-wordpress](../../roles/web-app-wordpress/) calls them `plugins` (and separately `mu_plugins`) under [tasks/plugins/](../../roles/web-app-wordpress/tasks/plugins/).
- [web-app-mediawiki](../../roles/web-app-mediawiki/) calls them `extensions` and hard-codes the list in [vars/main.yml](../../roles/web-app-mediawiki/vars/main.yml).
- [web-app-xwiki](../../roles/web-app-xwiki/) calls them `plugins` (with nested `items[].id` + `version`) under `xwiki.plugins` in [meta/services.yml](../../roles/web-app-xwiki/meta/services.yml).
- [web-app-joomla](../../roles/web-app-joomla/) builds a single OIDC `plugin` in [tasks/07_oidc_plugin.yml](../../roles/web-app-joomla/tasks/07_oidc_plugin.yml).
- [desk-gnome-extensions](../../roles/desk-gnome-extensions/) calls them `plugins`/`extensions` and loops over `services.gnome-extensions.plugins`.

The [per-role meta layout](../contributing/design/role/services/layout.md) already lists `addons`, `plugins`, and `modules` among the keys *inlined* under the primary service entity. This requirement promotes that concept to a first-class, file-rooted `meta/addons.yml` topic, the same move requirement 011 made for `meta/info.yml` and requirement 008/009 made for other meta topics.

A recurring property of these extensions is that many of them exist **only to bridge into another role**: `ldapauth` and `user_ldap` bridge to `svc-db-openldap`; `sociallogin`, `oidc-authenticator`, `OpenIDConnect`, `plg_system_keycloak`, and the WordPress OIDC plugin bridge to the SSO provider (`web-app-keycloak`); `wp-discourse` bridges to `web-app-discourse`; XWiki's `matomo` plugin bridges to `web-app-matomo`. Today that bridge is implicit. This requirement makes it explicit: **an addon that bridges to another role MUST declare the bridged service, and that service MUST be present in the role's `meta/services.yml`.**

## Confirmed Decisions

These choices are settled at requirement creation time and bound the implementation. Re-opening any of them MUST be recorded in the implementing PR.

1. **One file, one topic.** Addon definitions live in `roles/<role>/meta/addons.yml`. The file-root convention applies: the file content IS the value of `applications.<role_id>.addons`, with no wrapping `addons:` key (see [layout.md](../contributing/design/role/services/layout.md)). The materialised path is `applications.<role_id>.addons.<addon_id>`, read via `lookup('config', application_id, 'addons.<addon_id>')`.
2. **Unified schema, native mechanism preserved.** Every addon entry uses one schema across all roles. The app-native term is retained only as the `mechanism` field (`addon`, `plugin`, `mu_plugin`, `extension`, `module`, `bridge`). Tasks keep using the upstream installer for that mechanism; only the *declaration* is unified. App-specific runtime configuration is carried under an opaque `config:` mapping that only the owning role's tasks interpret, so the surrounding schema stays uniform while each addon keeps its full per-addon payload. `meta/addons.yml` is therefore the single source for both the declaration and the runtime config: where a role previously split the enable/disable declaration from a per-addon config payload (e.g. Nextcloud's [vars/plugins/](../../roles/web-app-nextcloud/vars/plugins/)), both move into `meta/addons.yml` and the superseded per-addon config files are deleted by the migration.
3. **Bridges are explicit and validated.** When an addon itself integrates with another role, it MUST list the bridged service key under `bridges:`. Each listed key MUST resolve to a service block already declared in the same role's `meta/services.yml`. Lint fails otherwise. Front-door auth gates such as oauth2-proxy are not addon bridges unless the addon itself talks to that service. **Two distinct meanings of "bridge" exist and MUST NOT be conflated:** the `bridges:` *field* names an in-repo cross-role service dependency (e.g. an addon that talks to `svc-db-openldap`), whereas `mechanism: bridge` marks an addon that *is* a network/appservice bridge to an external system (e.g. a Matrix mautrix bridge to WhatsApp/Telegram). A single addon MAY be both: a `mechanism: bridge` addon MAY also declare a `bridges:` dependency on an in-repo service it relies on.
4. **No new secret store.** Any credential an addon needs continues to be declared in [`meta/schema.yml`](../contributing/design/role/services/layout.md) `credentials:` and read via `lookup('config', application_id, 'credentials.<name>')`.
5. **Enable state defaults to off.** `enabled` is optional and defaults to `false` unless `required: true` is set. An addon that bridges a service SHOULD derive its effective enablement from that service's `enabled` flag rather than a duplicated group-membership expression.
6. **Required addons are explicit, and install failure is gated by `required`.** Every addon carries a boolean `required` field (default `false`). Core components that are part of the deployed app contract, such as Odoo's core modules, use `required: true`: they are always installed, MAY omit `enabled`, and MUST NOT set `enabled: false`. The field also governs install-failure behaviour: when an addon's installation fails, a `required: true` addon MUST hard-fail the play (the deploy stops), while a `required: false` addon MUST only emit a warning, skip that addon, and let the play continue.
7. **Workload-neutral contract.** `meta/addons.yml` applies to any role type that declares role-level extensions, including desktop roles such as `desk-gnome-extensions`. The materialised path still uses the role's assembled application entry, `applications.<role_id>.addons`.
8. **First slice.** The first end-to-end migration is `web-app-friendica` (`ldapauth`, bridges `ldap` to `svc-db-openldap`), because it already exercises the bridge rule and the service-flag enablement path.
9. **External drift monitoring.** Addon freshness is checked by opt-in external tests under `tests/external/update/addons/`. These tests are warn-only, emit GitHub Actions warning annotations, and are excluded from `make test` in the same way as Docker image and repository-ref external update checks.
10. **Update PR behaviour.** The scheduled update workflow MAY open or refresh an update pull request for addon version bumps and newly discovered catalog entries. New addon entries MUST be added disabled by default and MUST NOT silently enable new runtime behaviour.
11. **Every addon ships a Playwright test.** Each addon with a user-facing surface MUST add a matching Playwright spec under `roles/<role>/files/playwright/` that exercises that addon's behaviour (e.g. an `ldapauth`/`sociallogin` login path, a `wp-discourse` round-trip, an enabled Odoo module's UI entry point). An addon with no web-facing surface (e.g. a `desk-gnome-extensions` desktop extension) is exempt and MUST carry a one-line note in the role README stating why. No addon is considered implemented or migrated until its Playwright test is present and green, or its exemption is documented.
12. **Addon state is a variant axis.** Optional addons (`required: false`) MUST express their enabled/disabled split through the role's [`meta/variants.yml`](../contributing/design/role/services/layout.md) so CI matrix runs exercise both states, mirroring requirement 025's MCP variant axis. Required addons (`required: true`) are not a variant axis because they are always installed.
13. **Network bridges are addons.** Appservice / network bridges (e.g. the Matrix `mautrix` bridges to WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Slack, Facebook, Instagram) are addons declared in `meta/addons.yml` with `mechanism: bridge`, one entry per bridged network. Each bridge owns its credentials in [`meta/schema.yml`](../contributing/design/role/services/layout.md) and is `required: false` and disabled by default. The role's former bridge declarations (e.g. `web-app-matrix`'s [vars/bridges.yml](../../roles/web-app-matrix/vars/bridges.yml)) are absorbed into `meta/addons.yml`.

## Current State Audit

Each row is a migration target. The "Bridges" column is the cross-role dependency this requirement makes explicit. "Today's location" is where the declaration lives before migration.

### Out of scope: database/runtime engine extensions

Two roles declare an `extensions:` key that is **not** an application addon but a database/cache engine feature, provisioned at the storage layer. These MUST stay where they are and MUST NOT move into `meta/addons.yml`:

- [web-app-mobilizon](../../roles/web-app-mobilizon/) — PostgreSQL extensions `postgis, pg_trgm, unaccent` ([meta/services.yml](../../roles/web-app-mobilizon/meta/services.yml)).
- [web-app-bookwyrm](../../roles/web-app-bookwyrm/) — engine extension `bloom` ([meta/services.yml](../../roles/web-app-bookwyrm/meta/services.yml)).

The audit MUST classify these as `db-extension` (out of scope), so a later sweep does not mistake them for app addons. If a future role mixes app addons and DB extensions under one key, the migration MUST split them by destination.

A grep for `meta/addons.yml` before implementation MUST return nothing, and that baseline MUST be recorded in the implementing PR.

## Target Schema

### Addon declaration: `meta/addons.yml`

Every role that ships role-level extensions MUST declare them in `roles/<role>/meta/addons.yml`. The file root IS the addons map keyed by `<addon_id>`. There is NO wrapping `addons:` key.

```yaml
# roles/web-app-friendica/meta/addons.yml  (file root IS the addons map)
ldapauth:
  enabled: "{{ lookup('config', application_id, 'services.ldap.enabled') | bool }}"
  required: false             # true for core modules that must always install
  mechanism: addon            # addon | plugin | mu_plugin | extension | module
  source: upstream            # upstream | bundled | vendored | built
  bridges:                    # optional; service keys declared in meta/services.yml
    - ldap
  version: ""                 # optional upstream pin; "" means upstream default
  group: optional             # optional grouping label (e.g. odoo core/optional)
  update:
    monitored: true           # optional; external tests check latest versions
    catalog: friendica-addons # optional; supported upstream catalog adapter
    upstream_id: ldapauth     # optional; defaults to addon id
```

Field rules:

- `enabled` (optional) defaults to `false` when omitted, except when `required: true` is set. When the addon bridges exactly one service, `enabled` SHOULD reference that service's `enabled` flag rather than re-deriving group membership.
- `required` (optional) defaults to `false`. When `required: true`, the addon is part of the role's baseline install contract, is treated as enabled even when `enabled` is omitted, and MUST NOT set `enabled: false`. `required` also gates install-failure handling: a failed install of a `required: true` addon MUST hard-fail the play; a failed install of a `required: false` addon MUST emit a warning, skip the addon, and continue.
- `mechanism` (required) MUST be one of `addon`, `plugin`, `mu_plugin`, `extension`, `module`, `bridge`. It records the upstream installation mechanism and selects which task path installs the addon. `mechanism: bridge` denotes a network/appservice bridge addon (see Confirmed Decision 13) and is distinct from the `bridges:` field below.
- `source` (required) MUST be one of `upstream` (installed from the app's own registry), `bundled` (ships with the image), `vendored` (committed under `roles/<role>/files/`), or `built` (compiled/zipped during the play, e.g. the Joomla OIDC plugin).
- `bridges` (optional) MUST be a non-empty list when present. Each entry MUST name a service key that exists in the same role's `meta/services.yml`. Omit the key entirely when the addon has no cross-role dependency.
- `version` (optional) MUST be a string. `""` means "track the app's default". A concrete pin MUST be a string, never an unquoted number.
- `group` (optional) is a free label used by roles that partition addons (e.g. Odoo `core` vs `optional`). It MUST NOT affect enablement.
- `update` (optional) controls live upstream monitoring. `update.monitored` defaults to `false`; `update.catalog` MUST name a supported external-test catalog adapter; `update.upstream_id` defaults to `<addon_id>`.
- `config` (optional) is an opaque, role-interpreted mapping holding the addon's full runtime configuration payload (e.g. Nextcloud `occ config:app` key/value sets, OIDC provider blocks). Lint MUST NOT constrain its inner shape beyond requiring a mapping; only the owning role's tasks read it. Secrets inside `config` MUST resolve through `lookup('config', application_id, 'credentials.<name>')` and MUST NOT be inlined literally.

#### Worked example: absorbing per-addon config

A Nextcloud plugin that previously lived as a standalone config file moves wholesale into its `config:` block:

```yaml
# roles/web-app-nextcloud/meta/addons.yml  (excerpt)
sociallogin:
  enabled: "{{ lookup('config', application_id, 'services.sso.enabled') | bool }}"
  mechanism: plugin
  source: upstream
  bridges:
    - sso
  config:
    plugin_configuration:
      - appid: sociallogin
        configkey: custom_providers
        configvalue:
          custom_oidc:
            - name: "{{ lookup('domain','web-app-keycloak') }}"
              clientId: "{{ OIDC.CLIENT.ID }}"
              clientSecret: "{{ OIDC.CLIENT.SECRET }}"
              # ... remaining provider keys, verbatim from the former vars/plugins/sociallogin.yml ...
```

The former [roles/web-app-nextcloud/vars/plugins/sociallogin.yml](../../roles/web-app-nextcloud/vars/plugins/sociallogin.yml) is deleted; the install/enable/configure tasks read `applications.web-app-nextcloud.addons.sociallogin.config` instead.

#### Worked example: network bridge addon

A Matrix mautrix bridge becomes one addon entry per bridged network, absorbing the former [vars/bridges.yml](../../roles/web-app-matrix/vars/bridges.yml):

```yaml
# roles/web-app-matrix/meta/addons.yml  (excerpt)
mautrix-telegram:
  enabled: false
  required: false
  mechanism: bridge
  source: upstream
  config:
    bridge_name: telegram
    database_username: mautrix_telegram_bridge
    database_name: mautrix_telegram_bridge
    database_password: "{{ lookup('config', application_id, 'credentials.mautrix_telegram_bridge_database_password') }}"
```

The bridge's database password stays declared in [meta/schema.yml](../../roles/web-app-matrix/meta/schema.yml) `credentials:` and is referenced, never inlined. Each additional network (`whatsapp`, `signal`, `slack`, `facebook`, `instagram`) is its own `mechanism: bridge` addon.

### Install-failure handling

The install task path for every addon MUST honour the `required` field:

- A `required: true` addon whose install step fails MUST fail the play (no `failed_when: false` swallowing the error).
- A `required: false` addon whose install step fails MUST register the failure, emit a warning (role log line plus, in CI, a GitHub Actions warning annotation via `utils.annotations.message.warning`), skip the addon's remaining steps, and let the play continue.
- The warning MUST name the role, the addon id, and the failing step so the operator can act without reading raw task output.

### Bridge rule

The central rule of this requirement:

> For every addon entry with a non-empty `bridges:` list, each listed service key MUST be declared as a service block in the same role's `meta/services.yml`, following the established cross-role flag pattern.

Example: the `ldapauth` addon above requires that [web-app-friendica/meta/services.yml](../../roles/web-app-friendica/meta/services.yml) already declares:

```yaml
# roles/web-app-friendica/meta/services.yml  (excerpt)
ldap:
  enabled: "{{ 'svc-db-openldap' in group_names }}"
  shared:  "{{ 'svc-db-openldap' in group_names }}"
```

Rules:

- An addon MUST NOT bridge a service that is absent from `meta/services.yml`; lint fails with the missing key named.
- A bridged service block MUST carry the standard `enabled` / `shared` flags so requirement 019 (services.yml parity) and the SSO/LDAP coverage requirements (017, 018) continue to apply unchanged.
- The bridge declaration is one-directional metadata (this role depends on that service). It MUST NOT be used to auto-enable the other role; enablement stays driven by group membership and the existing `run_after` ordering.
- If a role uses another service around the application but the addon does not talk to that service directly, the service MUST stay in `meta/services.yml` and MUST NOT be listed in the addon's `bridges:`. Friendica's oauth2-proxy-backed `sso` service is such a front-door auth gate for `ldapauth`.

### Materialised path and loader

- `meta/addons.yml.<addon_id>.<...>` materialises at `applications.<role_id>.addons.<addon_id>.<...>`, consistent with the file-root convention in [layout.md](../contributing/design/role/services/layout.md).
- The existing application loader (`utils/cache/applications.py`) MUST load `meta/addons.yml` like the other file-rooted meta topics. No new generated repository-wide dictionary is introduced.
- The `addons` key MUST be removed from the "inlined under the primary entity" set in [layout.md](../contributing/design/role/services/layout.md) and documented as its own topic file.

### External update monitoring

Addon monitoring MUST follow the existing external-update pattern used for Docker image versions and repository refs.

Rules:

- Live upstream checks MUST live under `tests/external/update/addons/` and run through `make test-external`, not through the default `make test` flow.
- The external addon test MUST emit warnings, not failures, when a monitored addon has a newer upstream version.
- The external addon test MUST emit warnings, not failures, when a supported catalog adapter detects a new relevant addon that is not listed in `meta/addons.yml`.
- Catalog discovery MUST be bounded by explicit adapters and curated relevance rules. The test MUST NOT warn for every package in broad public marketplaces such as the full WordPress plugin directory.
- New addon suggestions MUST include enough data for review: role id, addon id, upstream id, mechanism, source, catalog URL, and why the addon is considered relevant.
- Version suggestions MUST include the current pinned version, latest upstream version, source file, and line number where possible.
- The scheduled update workflow MUST be able to reuse the same discovery logic in update mode. Version bumps MAY update `version`; new addon entries MAY be added with `enabled: false`, `required: false`, and complete `update` metadata.
- Update automation MUST preserve existing `enabled`, `required`, `bridges`, and credential-related fields, and MUST NOT enable newly discovered addons automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Repository-wide audit

- [ ] A deterministic audit command or test enumerates every role under `roles/` and classifies addon support by `mechanism` (`addon`, `plugin`, `mu_plugin`, `extension`, `module`, `bridge`), `db-extension` (out of scope), or `none`.
- [ ] The audit reproduces every row of the [Current State Audit](#current-state-audit) — including the `bridge`-mechanism (`web-app-matrix`), the newly surveyed `plugin`/`extension` roles (`web-app-discourse`, `web-app-pretix`, `web-app-mattermost`, `desk-chromium`, `desk-firefox`, `desk-gnome`), and the out-of-scope `db-extension` roles (`web-app-mobilizon`, `web-app-bookwyrm`) — and records, per role, the addon ids, their `mechanism`, their `required` state, and their `bridges`.
- [ ] A grep for `meta/addons.yml` before implementation is recorded in the implementing PR to show the baseline was empty.

### Shared contract

- [ ] [layout.md](../contributing/design/role/services/layout.md) documents `meta/addons.yml`: file-root convention, the addon schema, field defaults, allowed values, and the materialised path; and removes `addons` from the inlined-key list.
- [ ] The application loader reads `meta/addons.yml` for every role and exposes `applications.<role_id>.addons.<addon_id>` through `lookup('config', application_id, 'addons.<addon_id>')`.
- [ ] Role-meta lint under [`tests/lint/ansible/services/`](../../tests/lint/ansible/services/) rejects an invalid `mechanism` (outside the `addon`/`plugin`/`mu_plugin`/`extension`/`module`/`bridge` set), an invalid `source`, an invalid `update.catalog`, an empty `bridges: []`, a non-string `version`, a non-boolean `required`, `required: true` combined with `enabled: false`, a non-mapping `config`, a literal secret inlined in `config`, and missing required fields, honouring the `# nocheck:` suppression convention.
- [ ] After the Nextcloud migration, no `roles/web-app-nextcloud/vars/plugins/*.yml` plugin-config file remains; a test asserts the directory's former per-plugin payloads now live under `applications.web-app-nextcloud.addons.<id>.config`.

### Bridge contract

- [ ] Lint fails when an addon's `bridges:` entry names a service key absent from the same role's `meta/services.yml`, and the error message names the role, addon id, and missing service key.
- [ ] Lint verifies that every bridged service block carries `enabled` and `shared` flags.
- [ ] A bridged addon's `enabled` value referencing its single bridged service's `enabled` flag passes lint without a duplicated group-membership expression.
- [ ] Lint allows role-level service dependencies that are not addon bridges, such as Friendica's `sso` front-door auth gate, to remain in `meta/services.yml` without appearing under an unrelated addon's `bridges:`.

### Per-role migration

- [ ] [web-app-friendica](../../roles/web-app-friendica/) declares `ldapauth` in `meta/addons.yml` with `bridges: [ldap]`; the `ldap` and `sso` service blocks remain in `meta/services.yml`; [tasks/04_addons.yml](../../roles/web-app-friendica/tasks/04_addons.yml) reads the addon list from the new path; deploy behaviour is unchanged.
- [ ] [web-app-odoo](../../roles/web-app-odoo/) declares its `core` and `optional` modules in `meta/addons.yml` using `mechanism: module`, `required: true` for core modules, and the `group` label; the install path reads the new path.
- [ ] [web-app-nextcloud](../../roles/web-app-nextcloud/) declares each plugin in `meta/addons.yml`; `sociallogin` bridges `sso` and `user_ldap` bridges `ldap`, both present in `meta/services.yml`; each plugin's full runtime config from [vars/plugins/](../../roles/web-app-nextcloud/vars/plugins/) is absorbed into its addon `config:` block and the superseded `vars/plugins/*.yml` files are deleted; the install/enable/configure tasks read the addon `config:` payload; deploy behaviour is unchanged.
- [ ] [web-app-wordpress](../../roles/web-app-wordpress/) declares its `plugin` and `mu_plugin` entries in `meta/addons.yml`; the OIDC plugin bridges `sso` and `wp-discourse` bridges the Discourse service.
- [ ] [web-app-mediawiki](../../roles/web-app-mediawiki/) declares `PluggableAuth` and `OpenIDConnect` in `meta/addons.yml` with `mechanism: extension`; `OpenIDConnect` bridges `sso`.
- [ ] [web-app-xwiki](../../roles/web-app-xwiki/) declares its three plugins in `meta/addons.yml`, preserving `version` pins; bridges `sso`, `ldap`, and `matomo` resolve to service blocks.
- [ ] [web-app-joomla](../../roles/web-app-joomla/) declares `plg_system_keycloak` in `meta/addons.yml` with `mechanism: plugin`, `source: built`, and `bridges: [sso]`.
- [ ] [web-app-matrix](../../roles/web-app-matrix/) declares each mautrix network bridge in `meta/addons.yml` with `mechanism: bridge`, `required: false`, `enabled: false` by default, and its DB credential referenced from `meta/schema.yml`; [vars/bridges.yml](../../roles/web-app-matrix/vars/bridges.yml) is absorbed and deleted.
- [ ] [web-app-discourse](../../roles/web-app-discourse/) declares its plugins in `meta/addons.yml` with `mechanism: plugin`; `discourse-ldap-auth` carries `bridges: [ldap]` resolving to the `ldap` service block, while `docker_manager`, `discourse-activity-pub`, and `discourse-akismet` carry no `bridges`.
- [ ] [web-app-pretix](../../roles/web-app-pretix/) declares its `oidc` plugin in `meta/addons.yml` with `mechanism: plugin`, the `2.3.1` pin preserved as a string `version`, and `bridges: [sso]`.
- [ ] [web-app-mattermost](../../roles/web-app-mattermost/) declares its plugins in `meta/addons.yml` with `mechanism: plugin`; the plugin volumes remain in `meta/volumes.yml`.
- [ ] [desk-chromium](../../roles/desk-chromium/) and [desk-firefox](../../roles/desk-firefox/) declare their browser extensions in `meta/addons.yml` with `mechanism: extension`, no `bridges`, and a documented Playwright exemption (no in-app web surface to drive).
- [ ] [desk-gnome](../../roles/desk-gnome/) declares its gnome-shell extensions in `meta/addons.yml` with `mechanism: extension` and no `bridges`.
- [ ] [desk-gnome-extensions](../../roles/desk-gnome-extensions/) declares its extensions in `meta/addons.yml` with `mechanism: extension` and no `bridges`.
- [ ] [web-app-mobilizon](../../roles/web-app-mobilizon/) and [web-app-bookwyrm](../../roles/web-app-bookwyrm/) keep their `extensions:` (PostgreSQL/engine extensions) in `meta/services.yml`; they are classified `db-extension` and explicitly NOT migrated to `meta/addons.yml`.

### External drift and update PRs

- [ ] `tests/external/update/addons/` contains a warn-only external test that checks every addon with `update.monitored=true` for newer upstream versions.
- [ ] The external addon test emits GitHub Actions warning annotations for outdated addon versions and for relevant new catalog entries that are not listed in `meta/addons.yml`.
- [ ] The external addon test is runnable through `make test-external` and is intentionally excluded from the default `make test` flow.
- [ ] The supported catalog adapters are documented and bounded so broad marketplaces do not produce unreviewable warning noise.
- [ ] The scheduled update workflow opens or refreshes an update pull request when addon versions can be bumped or when relevant new addon entries can be added.
- [ ] Update automation adds newly discovered addons with `enabled: false`, `required: false`, complete `update` metadata, and no credentials.
- [ ] Update automation preserves existing enablement, bridge, required, and credential-related fields when bumping addon versions.

### Tests

- [ ] Unit or integration tests validate the addon schema and reject unsafe or malformed entries.
- [ ] A parity test (in the spirit of requirement 019) asserts that every addon `bridges:` key has a matching `meta/services.yml` block, repo-wide.
- [ ] A schema test verifies that `enabled` may be omitted, defaults to `false` for optional addons, defaults to true for `required: true`, and rejects `required: true` with `enabled: false`.
- [ ] An install-failure test proves that a failing `required: true` addon hard-fails the play, while a failing `required: false` addon emits a warning, is skipped, and the play continues.
- [ ] Each role with optional (`required: false`) addons expresses the enabled/disabled split as a `meta/variants.yml` axis so the CI matrix exercises both states (mirroring requirement 025).
- [ ] Unit tests cover the external addon discovery logic with fixture catalogs for a version bump, a newly discovered addon, and a marketplace entry intentionally ignored by the curated relevance rules.
- [ ] Each migrated role's existing deploy path stays green; no addon behaviour regresses.
- [ ] LDAP- and SSO-bridging addons remain covered by the existing Playwright LDAP/SSO requirements (017/018) without new per-role wiring.
- [ ] Every addon with a user-facing surface ships a matching Playwright spec under `roles/<role>/files/playwright/` covering that addon's behaviour, and that spec is green before the addon is marked migrated; web-surface-less addons carry a documented README exemption instead.

### Documentation

- [ ] [layout.md](../contributing/design/role/services/layout.md) and the [plugins README](../../plugins/README.md) cross-reference each other so the Ansible-`plugins/` concept and the application-`addons` concept are not conflated.
- [ ] Each migrated role README documents its addons, their `mechanism`, default state, and which services they bridge.
- [ ] This requirement file is cross-linked from the implementing PR.

## Validation Apps

The implementation MUST validate the bridge rule and the loader on the first slice before sweeping the rest:

```bash
INFINITO_APPS="web-app-friendica" \
  make deploy-fresh-purged-apps INFINITO_FULL_CYCLE=true
```

After the first slice is green, each migrated role MUST pass its role-local deploy path and any matrix variants affected by the migration.

## Prerequisites

Before starting implementation work, the agent MUST read [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) and follow all instructions in it.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Add the `meta/addons.yml` schema and loader support, the `tests/lint/ansible/services/` lint rules (schema + bridge resolution), and the [layout.md](../contributing/design/role/services/layout.md) documentation.
2. Add the repo-wide bridge-parity test.
3. Add the external addon update checker, its fixture-backed unit tests, and update-workflow integration for warn-only drift detection and update pull requests.
4. Migrate `web-app-friendica` as the first end-to-end slice (addon list + bridge resolution + task rewire) and prove deploy parity.
5. Sweep the remaining roles one at a time: odoo, nextcloud, wordpress, mediawiki, xwiki, joomla, matrix (bridges), discourse, pretix, mattermost, desk-chromium, desk-firefox, desk-gnome, and desk-gnome-extensions. Keep each role's README, variants, and tests aligned. Leave the out-of-scope `db-extension` roles (mobilizon, bookwyrm) untouched.
6. Remove `addons` from the inlined-key set once every role is migrated.

## Commit Policy

- The shared schema, loader, lint, and the first migrated role MAY land together.
- Each additional role SHOULD land in a focused commit or PR when it can be validated independently.
- The implementing PR MUST NOT mark any Acceptance Criterion complete until the behavior is verified end to end.
