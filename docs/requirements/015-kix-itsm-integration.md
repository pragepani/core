# 015 - KIX Service Management integration

## User Story

As an operator running an Infinito.Nexus stack, I want [KIX Start](https://www.kixdesk.com/) deployed as a first-class `web-app-*` role, fronted by `web-app-keycloak`'s SSO-proxy sidecar so that **every** access to KIX is gated by Keycloak SSO with the realm's 2FA policy enforced, and so that helpdesk tickets share the same identity store, mail relay, dashboard, logout flow and proxy edge as every other service on the host.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A new `roles/web-app-kix/` exists and conforms to the role-meta layout from [req-008](./008-role-meta-layout.md), [req-009](./009-per-role-networks-and-ports.md), [req-010](./010-role-meta-runafter-lifecycle-migration.md) and [req-011](./011-role-meta-info-migration.md): `meta/services.yml`, `meta/server.yml`, `meta/main.yml`, `meta/info.yml`, `vars/main.yml`, `tasks/main.yml` (thin wrapper with `run_once_web_app_kix` guard), `tasks/01_core.yml`, `templates/compose.yml.j2`, `README.md`.
- [x] The role declares its host-bound ports under `meta/services.yml.<entity>.ports.local.http` inside the `local.http` band from `group_vars/all/08_networks.yml`, picked via `cli meta ports suggest`.
- [x] The role declares a per-role docker subnet under `meta/server.yml.networks.local.subnet`, picked via `cli meta networks suggest`.
- [x] KIX is reachable at `kix.{{ DOMAIN_PRIMARY }}` over TLS through `sys-stk-front-proxy` and emits HSTS.
- [x] An `web-app-keycloak`'s SSO-proxy sidecar instance sits between `sys-stk-front-proxy` and the KIX backend: every request to `kix.{{ DOMAIN_PRIMARY }}` that does not carry a valid OAuth2-proxy session cookie is redirected to Keycloak. The KIX backend is NOT reachable directly from the front proxy without traversing the OAuth2 proxy.
- [x] 2FA enforcement is realm-level: the Keycloak realm that backs the OAuth2 proxy has an OTP / WebAuthn flow configured, so a user without a second factor cannot complete the OAuth2 proxy redirect chain. The realm-level configuration is the single source of truth, so no 2FA logic lives in KIX or the role itself.
- [x] LDAP is wired as KIX's user-directory backend against `svc-db-openldap` (`Auth::LDAP` + `Auth::Sync::LDAP`): when a user authenticates against KIX their profile (display name, email, role group) is sourced from LDAP, so no manual KIX-side user pre-creation is required.
- [x] The `web-app-dashboard` role surfaces a card for KIX that links to its canonical URL, with the logo / title resolved via the standard `lookup('config', 'web-app-kix', ...)` path used by every other dashboard tile.
- [x] The universal logout endpoint terminates a KIX session like any other Infinito.Nexus app: the KIX session cookie is cleared and the browser lands on the project logout page.
- [x] An end-to-end Playwright spec at `roles/web-app-kix/files/playwright/playwright.spec.js` covers the in-scope flow: TLS root + HSTS at `kix.{{ DOMAIN_PRIMARY }}`; anonymous request to the canonical URL redirects into the OAuth2-proxy / Keycloak chain (the realm-level 2FA step is exercised by the shared `web-app-keycloak` Playwright suite, not duplicated per-app).

## Deferred (KIX 18 OSS frontend limitation)

KIX 18 OSS exposes both `Auth::HTTPBasicAuth` (which reads
`REMOTE_USER` / `HTTP_REMOTE_USER`, semantically equivalent to
OTRS' `Auth::HTTPHeaderModule`) and a fully featured
`Auth::LDAP` + `Auth::Sync::LDAP` backend, so both are wired by
this role. The KIX 18 Angular frontend SPA, however, ships its own
login route (`/auth?redirectUrl=…`) and does not auto-submit
credentials based on the API-side `Remote-User` env. As a result
an authenticated oauth2-proxy session reaches the KIX UI and the
backend trusts the forwarded identity for API requests, but the
SPA still renders its own login form on first visit; the user
re-authenticates against the KIX login form against `Auth::LDAP`.

A truly transparent SPA-side SSO (login form skipped) requires a
small KIX frontend modification (wired to the existing
`Auth::HTTPBasicAuth` endpoint) and is tracked as a follow-on
iteration, not part of req-015.
