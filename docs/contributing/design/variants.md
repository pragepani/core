# Variants 🧬

How the development deploy CLI consumes per-role `meta/variants.yml` and iterates the resulting matrix at deploy time.

## Folder-per-round model 🎛️

The development deploy CLI uses a **folder-per-round model** that splits cleanly between the init step (which materialises the inventories) and the deploy step (which iterates them):

1. **Round count.** `total_rounds = max(variant_count for app in primary_apps)`. If every primary app has only one variant, both steps degrade to a single folder and the unsuffixed inventory path is used.
2. **Per-round variant selection.** In round R every primary app uses variant index `R if R < its_variant_count else 0`. So a single-variant app stays on variant 0 in every round, and a 3-variant app in a 5-round deploy follows `0, 1, 2, 0, 0`.
3. **Inventory folders.** [init.py](../../../cli/administration/deploy/development/init.py) calls [build_dev_inventory_matrix](../../../cli/administration/deploy/development/inventory/builder.py), which creates one folder per round at `<inventory-dir>-<round>` (or just `<inventory-dir>` when there is a single round). For each folder, `build_dev_inventory` resolves the round's per-app variant payload and bakes it into the inventory's `host_vars` as `applications.<app>: <variant-payload>` overrides. The inventory is therefore variant-resolved on disk; no runtime selector is needed.
4. **Deploy iteration.** [deploy.py](../../../cli/administration/deploy/development/deploy.py) re-derives the same plan via `plan_dev_inventory_matrix` (the planner is a pure function shared between init and deploy) and runs one deploy per folder. **Every round deploys its full variant-aware include set.** Round R starts from a clean host (the previous round's include is purged before round R begins, see point 5), so every dep round R needs MUST be redeployed.
5. **Cleanup between rounds.** Before each non-first iteration the wrapper runs [entity.sh](../../../scripts/tests/deploy/local/purge/entity.sh) for **every** app in the previous round's include set. The next round therefore boots from an empty host, which guarantees cross-round state coherence: nothing the previous round deployed (whether it stays in the current round's closure or falls out) can leak into round R, so variants are free to disagree on which deps they pull in. The final round is followed by no purge so the last state remains available for inspection or follow-up specs.
6. **`--full-cycle` (async update pass).** When set (or `full_cycle=true` on `make compose-deploy`, or `INFINITO_FULL_CYCLE=true` in the environment), the wrapper runs each round's deploy TWICE: first the regular sync pass, then immediately a second pass with `-e ASYNC_ENABLED=true` overriding the host_var, against the SAME variant's folder, BEFORE moving to the next round. The two passes are therefore always co-located on the same host state; the async pass never accidentally targets a host that a previous round's variant left behind.
7. **Pinning to a single round.** Both init and deploy accept `--variant <idx>` (or read the `INFINITO_VARIANT` environment variable) to pin operations to a single round's folder. In single-round mode no inter-round cleanup runs, since there is no previous round to diff against. The `make compose-deploy mode=update` flows honour the same `INFINITO_VARIANT` env-var by suffixing `INFINITO_INVENTORY_DIR` / `INFINITO_INVENTORY_FILE` to `<base>-<idx>`, so a redeploy can target one specific variant without iterating the full matrix.

The in-play loader (`utils.cache.applications.get_merged_applications`) always uses variant 0 as the default and lets the inventory's `applications.<app>` overrides win via deep merge: the inventory itself is the source of truth for what variant a round runs against.

## What not to do 🚫

- You MUST NOT introduce a parallel cache. The variants are cached per `roles_dir` inside `utils/cache/applications.py` and returned as deep copies; mutating the result MUST NOT corrupt subsequent lookups.
- You MUST NOT skip the inter-round purge.
- You MUST NOT introduce a runtime variant-selector extra-var. Variant data lives in the inventory after init; the deploy stage reads it as plain `applications.<app>` overrides.
